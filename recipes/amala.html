            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Amala and abula is one of the favourite meals of many people in the South Western part of Nigeria. Amala is typically made with dried yam (amala isu) which gives it a brown color, but it can be made with cassava (amala lafun) or plantain (amala ogede) as well.
            </p>
            <p>Abula, on the other hand is a mixture of gbegiri (bean soup) and ewedu, a draw soup. This food is usually served at parties, restaurants and some eatries.

            The process of making yam flour is different from cassava flour. You don’t really need to know how as elubo is readily available in the market. You can buy the processed one (I.e. powdered form) or the unprocessed one which you will have to take to the mill for processing. Whichever one you buy, it is advisable to sift out the grits and lumps before usage.
            </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 cups of water</li>
                <li>500 grams of Elubo</li>
                <li>1 cup Black Eyed or Brown Beans</li>
                <li>¹/2 teaspoon potash (optional)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ground crayfish</li>
                <li>1 cube of seasoning</li>
                <li>1 cooking spoon of palm oil</li>
                <li>1 medium size onion</li>
                <li>Pepper (to taste)</li>
                <li>salt (to taste)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place a pot on fire</li>
                <li>Pour water into the pot and allow to boil.</li>
                <li>When the water begins to boil bring it down from the
                fire and gradually begin to add the yam flour or cassava flour. Do not add the flour to the water while still on the fire unless you have been doing it before so as to avoid lumps.</li>
                <li>Start to turn the flour with a wooden stick (called omorogun) very quickly so as to prevent lumps from forming. Turn until it is smooth.</li>
                <li>If it is hard, add a little water. If it is too soft, add more flour. And turn until it is smooth.</li>
                <li>Bring it down from the fire and keep turning until it is smooth. Amala is ready. Pack into nylon wraps and put into food flask to keep hot.</li>
            </ol>
