        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Efo Riro needs no introduction as it’s one of the most popular vegetable soups in Nigeria and an absolute favorite of the Yorubas. It's quite an easy dish to prepare, as long as you follow the major instructions and requirements. <br>A major rule is; using tomatoes for Efo Riro is an absolute No No! All you need to use are Bell peppers and Scotch bonnets. Definitely no tomatoes!
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, to get the best out of Efo Riro, you need to use Palm Oil. Some people use vegetable oil though but I’m yet to eat any that’s made with vegetable oil that has wowed me.For me, I’ll say Palm Oil all the way! If you’ve got health concerns or allergies which limits your Palm Oil consumption, then feel free to use your preferred cooking oil.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the washed meat in a pot, add a little of water, season with salt, sliced onions, 2 seasoning cubes and allow to boil for 10-15 minutes, add 1-2 cups of water and cook till tender and the water is almost dried.</li>
            <li>Add the smoked fish, stockfish, add a cup of water and cook for another 10-15 minutes depending on the hardness of your stockfish, I love them when they are very soft. The water should be almost dried, don’t allow to burn.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from heat, place another pot on heat and pour in some palm oil, 200ml. Allow to heat before adding the sliced onions, ground pepper/tatashe, stir and allow to fry for another ten minutes while stirring occasionally to avoid burning.
            </li>
            <li>Add the cooked meat/stock fish/smoked fish, stir and allow to simmer for 5 minutes, add the crayfish, iru, stir and allow another 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add a seasoning cube, salt to taste, stir and add the spinach leaves. Stir all together and allow to simmer for another 3-5 minutes and you just made a delicious pot of efo riro.</li>
            <li>This is how to make efo riro soup in Nigeria, please serve with Eba, Pounded yam, rice, beans, Semolina, Amala or any other similar Nigerian Food of choice, I enjoy pairing with fufu the way it appears below.</li>
